# InsightPulse 🧠✨

Basic sentiment analysis and word cloud generation with Flask + VADER

---

## 📌 What is InsightPulse?

**InsightPulse** is a simple web application that allows users to analyze text input for:

* **Sentiment detection** (numerical polarity from -1 to +1) using VADER
* **Basic word extraction** (filtered by length > 3 characters)
* **Static word cloud generation** with the extracted words

Built with Python and Flask, using VADER for sentiment analysis and WordCloud for visualization.

## ⚙️ How to run the project on Replit

1. **Import repository or upload files to Replit**

2. **Install dependencies** (in shell or `replit.nix` file):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the app**

```bash
python main.py
```

Then access the URL generated by Replit.

## 🌍 How it works

The user writes text, selects the language (English or Spanish) and clicks "Analyze".  
The app detects sentiment using **VADER** (only works effectively in English) and filters basic words.  
Then generates a **static word cloud** where all filtered words appear with similar sizes.

**Note**: Spanish analysis is limited since VADER is optimized for English.
